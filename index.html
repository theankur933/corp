            <p>Nfts are digital assets that reflect real-world objects such as art, music, video, and other media.
                They are one-of-a-kind and may be purchased and traded using cryptocurrencies online. By
                allowing creators and artists to experiment with new ways of generating creativity and
                ownership, NFT plays a critical role in assisting people in achieving more economic
                independence. Despite being popular for years, nfts skyrocketed in popularity in 2021, with a
                global market capitalization of $52 billion.

            <span>PROBLEMS</span>
            <P>Despite the fact that NFTS investments are all the rage right now, the ability to handle them with
                the same precision and as part of mobile apps that people now use to track other investment
                instruments is still generally unavailable. Furthermore, there are only a few platforms that cater
                to customers who are unfamiliar with crypto lingo and processes.

            <span>OPPORTUNITY</span>
            <p>Allow customers to manage all of their investment assets in one spot, rather than having to exit
                the app and go to third-party platforms like the open sea.
